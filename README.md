# Staff Survey and ONS Wellbeing questions

For the the 2016 internal Staff Survey four of the standard ONS Personal Well-Being questions were included from the Office of National Statistics [(ONS)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/methodologies/surveysusingthe4officefornationalstatisticspersonalwellbeingquestions) were included. 

These were used to do statistical tests on correlation with HR metrics like turnover, sickness and appraisal.

This code has been reduced to one example and data has been synthesised using the synthpop package for both the ESR aggregate data and the staff survey data.
